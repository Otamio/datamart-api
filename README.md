# Datamart-API

## Setting up for development
First clone this repo. Now set up a virtual environment and activate it (we usually set it up in ./env). Install the requirements.

You need to configure Visual Studio Code to use the environment. Copy `.vscode/settings.linux.json` (for Linux and Macs, or `settings.windows.json` if you're using Windows) to `.vscode/settings.json` and set the `pythonPath` property to point to your virtual environment.
